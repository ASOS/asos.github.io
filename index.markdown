## Principal Software Engineer

ASOS are growing our engineering leadership capability and we really want to hear from engineers who are ready for the next step in their career. We recognise the world is a small place so location is open for discussion. The roles will operate under the ASOS version of a hybrid working model. 

### About you

You are a seasoned technologist with a depth of practical knowledge in guiding multi-discipline teams through the full delivery lifecycle of complex, large-scale, distributed software systems.

You have a breadth of exposure to engineering and architecture across technology disciplines. You really understand the unique aspects of software development, automated testing, quality assurance, data handling and integration.

You take pride in being considered a ‘go-to’ technical authority with deep knowledge and skills. You are happy to help teams and team members to deliver great software, whether through general advice and guidance, hands-on coaching, working through technical designs or as a point of escalation if required.

You are familiar with sync and async design patterns for enterprise integration and data, which are the foundation of reliability and resilience in complex, high-scale systems like ours.

We really want to hear from people who have a passion for producing quality software and systems that are cloud first. We use Microsoft Azure but transferable knowledge of other cloud providers is fine. For us, quality software is designed and built with a test-first mindset, following good software crafting approaches. Our software is built from the ground up with a security and operational readiness mindset. We use automated, repeatable CI/CD pipelines to deploy safely right through to production.

### About the role

As a Principal Software Engineer your goal is to make engineering - and our engineers - better, every day. You are approachable, collaborative and you actively nurture a diverse and inclusive workplace.

You work closely with engineering teams to refine their existing development practices, processes and technologies, as well as explore new ones. You help them to overcome technical hurdles of any size or complexity and if needed you will join a team to work on stories and code alongside them. You also work closely with your peers in the Principal Engineering team, to share your innovations and initiatives across Tech and to support others doing the same.

### The ASOS Way

We do things a certain way - The ASOS Way. It’s in our DNA and runs through everything we do. It defines who we are, what we do and how we do it. Some things change - these don’t.

### Passionate

We are proud to be a part of ASOS. We always give our best and we celebrate our successes.

### Customer Obsessed

We know our customers love fashion and we understand what they want. We know our stuff inside and out and we put our customers at the heart of everything we do.

Restlessly Innovative

We never stand still. We give it a go and we are brave.

Collaborative and Respectful

We work together to get the job done. We grow ideas from within. We make things happen and we do the right thing.

People are the future of our business and we have really big ideas. We know we need people who can turn these ideas into reality – it’s our people that make the difference.

### What can we offer you?  

- Competitive salary, pension, and private medical care scheme 

- Performance related bonus 

- Flex benefits allowance - which you can chose to take as extra cash, or use towards other benefits 

- 25 days paid annual leave + an extra day for your birthday 

- Employee discount (excellent savings off ASOS items across our full range) 

- Tech Develops - our internal tech focussed skills development programme to focus on your personal growth as a technologist 

- Opportunity to represent ASOS at industry leading events 

- Opportunity to help shape and drive our DE&I initiatives in Tech (like our WIT movement and Diversity mentoring in Tech) 

- Opportunity to make an impact from day one and work with the latest in cutting edge of technology 
 
We are equal! We’re committed to creating an inclusive workforce. We believe in a world where you have the freedom to explore and express yourself without judgement, no matter who you are or where you’re from. Where you value yourself and feel proud of who you are. Where individuality is a source of confidence, because difference makes the world a better place.
